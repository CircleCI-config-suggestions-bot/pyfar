cartesian               right handed carteasian coordinate system (x, y, z).
spherical_colatitude    returns (azimuth, colatitude, radius) whre the azimuth denotes the counter clockwise angle in the x/y-plane with 0 pointing in positive x-direction and pi/2 in positive y-direction. The colatitude denotes the angle downwards from the z-axis with 0 pointing in positve z-direction and pi in negative z-direction. The azimuth and colatitude can be in radians or degrees, the radius is always in meters.
